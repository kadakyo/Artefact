Sparrows were feeding in a freezing drizzle           
That while you watched turned to pieces of snow     
Riding a gradient invisible                                      
From silver aslant to random, white, and slow.        
There came a moment that you couldn’t tell.              
And then they clearly flew instead of fell.
